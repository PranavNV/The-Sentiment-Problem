# The-Sentiment-Problem
In this project, we delve into the intricate sociotechnical dimensions of sentiment analysis (SA). Our critical analysis encompasses a comprehensive review of 189 peer-reviewed papers, scrutinizing their applications, models, and datasets.

Within this repository, you'll find a structured tabulation of these reviewed papers. This format is designed to provide insights into how each paper has been categorized, illuminating the presence or absence of sentiment and the approach to sentiment analysis within them.

Please check out our paper on the same to read more of our findings:
